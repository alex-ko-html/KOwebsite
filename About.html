        <h1>Who?</h1>
        <p>Alex Ko is an Asian-American filmmaker. At the age of 13, Ko 
            began his professional career, debuting as the lead role in the Broadway musical BILLY ELLIOT. 
            He then went on to write ALEX KO: FROM IOWA TO BROADWAY, an autobiography chronicling his 
            journey as a young dancer moving from the Midwest to New York City. Published by HarperCollins, the 
            book was recognized by Barack Obama during his presidency at a convention celebrating Asian-American 
            contributions to the arts. At the age of 18, Ko moved to Paris, where he studied film and graduated with 
            high honors from The American University of Paris. Ko went on to produce, write, and direct short films in the French 
            language, including THE DUCK, which premiered at the Motovun Film Festival in Croatia and went on to screen at additional festivals across 
            Europe. His most recent film, THE YELLOW DRESS, won the audience award for Best Short at the Austin Film 
            Festival. On the writing front, Ko’s original feature TROY WHITE: AN EAST GERMAN ICE SKATING STORY is currently in development. 
            In addition, Ko is currently developing THE YANGS, an original action-thriller drama series centered around an Asian-American family of assassins.</p>
